# Join Zoom Meeting

This workflow allows you to do 3 things:

1. Highlight a Zoom link and hold down `Ctrl+Cmd+Z` to launch it without a new browser tab opening.
2. Type in `zm` in Alfred to launch your personal zoom meeting and copy the link to clipboard to share.
3. Type in `zm YOUR-ZOOM-LINK` to open any Zoom link from Alfred.

## Saving your Personal Zoom Meeting URL

To add your Personal Zoom Meeting URL, open Alfred Preferences, navigate to Workflows, open the `Join Zoom Meeting` workflow, click on the `[x]` in the top right corner and add the value for the variable `personal`.
